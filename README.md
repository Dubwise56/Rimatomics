WORKS WITH SAVES

Rimatomics adds nuclear power and energy weapons, and a custom research system guides you step by step through most of the features, with a few details being left for you to figure out. The nuclear power system scales from kilowatts to megawatts, with options for combinations of different types of cooling systems, turbines and reactor cores - plus upgrades. To make use of such massive amounts of power, an assortment of energy weapons has been added, microwave area denial systems, tesla coils, high energy lasers, railguns, anti mortar systems, threat detection, drop pod scramblers, many types of upgrade modules, and nuclear weapons.
